            Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

            The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

            It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

            Explanation:
            2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
            7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.

            Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

            Symbol       Value
            I             1
            V             5
            X             10
            L             50
            C             100
            D             500
            M             1000
            For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

            Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

            I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
            X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
            C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
            Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

            Example 1:

            Input: num = 3
            Output: "III"
            Example 2:

            Input: num = 4
            Output: "IV"
            Example 3:

            Input: num = 9

            Output: "LVIII"

            Example 5:

            Input: num = 1994
            Output: "MCMXCIV"

            Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

            The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

            Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
            Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
            Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
            Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
            If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
            Return the integer as the final result.
            Note:

            Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
            Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

                    After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
                    When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
